# Verse

You want to use "basic" commands, which should be included in vanilla minecraft - like /fly or /heal, on a daily basis?
You don't want to download & install 20 different plugins for that?

You've come to the right place!

With the Verse Collection, you'll get everything* you wanted and needed in one place!

At this moment the Verse Collection includes:

- /fly - Creative-like flying, vanishes after logging out.
- /heal - Fully Heal, Feed & saturate yourself or other quickly!
- /backpack - A double chest-sized virtual backpack for your belongings.
